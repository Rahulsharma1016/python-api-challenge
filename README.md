WeatherPy and VacationPy
Project Overview
This project is divided into two main parts:

WeatherPy
WeatherPy analyzes the relationship between weather variables and latitude using data from over 500 cities worldwide. The main components analyzed include:

Temperature
Humidity
Cloudiness
Wind Speed
The analysis is presented through various graphs comparing the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The specific graphs included are:

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

VacationPy

Plot the Cities on a World Map
- Using the CSV from the previous 'city_data_df' plot each City on a hvplot world map
- This reduced dataset was then renamed to 'hotel_df' consisting of the following columns:
    - City
    - Country
    - Longitude
    - Latitude
    - Humidity
    - Hotel Name - This was an empty column added to the dataframe ready for the next task
 
add gitignore file and output file as well. 
output file has 4 pictures from WeatherPy.
and gitignore file Has configure file. 
Api keys are under gitignore file
